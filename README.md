### 👋 Hi there! 

I'm Rahul Sharma, a software developer working for the Canadian Institute for Health Information. My goal is to improve our healthcare system by building solutions that leverage data and analytics. This may be in the form of reports, dashboards, or webpages that allow for more data driven decisions and ultimately, healthier Canadians all over the country. 

- 🎓 I graduated in 2020 with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (with honors) here in Toronto, Canada.
- 💼 My areas of expertise include business intelligence development, web development and data engineering.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a personal project where I can utilize docker, kubernetes, and CI/CD. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create my own API via Python
